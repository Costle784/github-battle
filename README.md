#Github Battle

This is a "Github Battle App". Enter in two Github usernames, and it'll declare a winner.

I built along with Tyler Mcginnis' React Fundamentals course. I highly recommend.

It uses Webpack as a code bundler, Babel to transpile the JSX and ES6, NPM for package manager. 

Fork n' clone it, or better yet, take the dern course!
